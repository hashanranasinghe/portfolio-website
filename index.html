        <h3>The Dictionary App</h3>
        <p>
          The BOTANY APP is a useful tool for students learning about plants. It
          has a collection of scientific names and their Sinhala meanings. The
          app allows the administrator to add, search, update, and delete words.
          Users can sign up for the app and search for terms using either the
          scientific name or the Sinhala name. The app stores all the
          information in a database called Firebase. It's a great resource for
          students studying botany and helps them easily find the meanings of
          scientific names in Sinhala.

        <h3>Android encryption and video sharing</h3>
        <p>
          The video-sharing app allows users to share their personal videos with
          their friends.To get started, users need to sign up for the app. Once
          signed in, they can upload their videos. When sharing a video, users
          can choose specific friends to share it with. The app uses a special
          encryption method called AES algorithm to protect the video's privacy.
          This means that the video is securely encoded and can only be viewed
          by the intended recipients. If a user wants to remove a video, they
          have the option to delete it from both their own device and the
          recipient's device, or just from their own device. It's a safe and
          convenient way to share videos with friends!
